# Melriver Website Recreation

This project is a personal endeavor to recreate the website of the design agency Melriver. The main objective is to learn and develop skills in using GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) for animations. The project is built using React and Next.js, with TypeScript for type safety and Tailwind CSS for styling.
